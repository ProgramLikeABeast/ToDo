## Notes

Because it is a first android application of the baby developer, even with the code of video tutorial I took a whole day working on it
trying to understand what I was doing and answer many whys. After this project I noticed that my course in Java OOP really applies in
industrial area. I should dive deeper into the subject from now on.
